# Net Salary Calculator

## Overview

The **Net Salary Calculator** is a simple tool developed in JavaScript that calculates an individual’s **net salary** after factoring in various deductions such as **KRA Tax (PAYE)**, **NHIF Deduction**, and **NSSF Deduction**. The calculator takes the user's **basic salary** and **benefits** as inputs, and then calculates the **gross salary**, **payee tax (KRA)**, **NHIF deduction**, **NSSF deduction**, and the **net salary**.

### Features
- **Gross Salary Calculation**: The sum of basic salary and any benefits provided.
- **PAYE Tax Calculation**: Based on Kenyan tax bands (simplified version).
- **NHIF Deduction**: Calculated based on salary ranges.
- **NSSF Deduction**: 6% of the basic salary, capped at KSh 1,080.
- **Net Salary**: The final salary after all deductions.
